## Deliverable 1
In this deliverable, the main activity was creating a functional login application.

The requirements were to use the best programming practices, clean smell code and elaborate testing.

## Deliverable 2

First, I analized the infraestructure AWS by initial project so my resume is showing to continue:

### Step 2
For this diagram, only it'll deploy the server application.

The layers working in the AWS cloud are the next:

✔️ Select a region  to work (us-west-1).

✔️ Create a VPC where you can find the private subnets through a Elastic container Service.

✔️ Each subnet needs to have a connection by RDS intance, in this part is necessary consider the auto-scaling to mantain the connection.

To continue, you can see the AWS Services that it have used to create the new infraestructure:
